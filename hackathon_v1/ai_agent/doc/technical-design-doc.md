# PlatformNexus Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This technical design document outlines the architecture, components, and implementation details for **PlatformNexus**, an innovative platform designed to enhance IT operations through natural language processing (NLP) interface, backed by LLMs and specialized AI agents to assist the engineers with their day-to-day tasks.

### 1.2 Scope
PlatformNexus aims to streamline IT operations by providing engineers with a natural language interface to interact with large language models (LLMs) and specialized AI agents. The platform will facilitate incident management, change request tracking, and application dependency evaluation through an intuitive user interface and powerful backend services.

### 1.3 System Overview
PlatformNexus integrates LLM with domain-specific agents to create a comprehensive solution for operations team. The system features:
- Natural language query processing for technical requests
- Real-time incident monitoring and management
- Specialized AI agents for common IT operational tasks
- Flexible backend LLM integration

### 1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **UI**: User Interface
- **CR**: Change Request

- MCP Client
- MCP Agent
- Context manager
- Response generator

#### 2.2.4 LLM Integration Layer
This layer provides abstraction for LLM backends and handles:
- LLM interfaces
- Prompt engineering
- Response processing

#### 2.2.5 Data Layer
This layer manages data and its operations:
- Application metrics Analyzer
- Application status Collector
- App Dependency dataset
- Change Requests dataset

### 2.3 Specialized Agent Descriptions

#### 2.3.1 Heal Agent
The Heal Agent specializes in automated remediation of common IT incidents. It can:
- Analyze incident data
- Recommend remediation steps
- Execute approved remediation workflows
- Generate Runbooks
- Learn from successful resolution patterns

#### 2.3.2 Change Request Tracker Agent
This agent finds a probable match between incident and change request:
- Parse Change Requests

## 4. System Interactions and User Journeys

### 4.1 Incident Retrieval User Journey

1. **Query Submission**
   - User enters natural language query
   - Frontend validates and sends to backend

2. **Query Parsing and Routing**
   - System analyzes query intent
   - Identifies target agent or LLM
   - Enriches query with context

3. **LLM Processing**
   - Selected LLM processes the enriched query
   - Generates preliminary response

4. **Agent Processing**
   - Specialized agent applies domain knowledge
   - Enhances LLM response with specific actions
   - Generates actionable recommendations

5. **Response Delivery**
   - Response is formatted according to preferences
   - Data is enriched with references and visualizations
   - Final response returned to user

### 4.2 Heal Agent User Journey

1. **Incident Detection**
   - System receives alert from monitoring tools
   - Incident details are captured and classified

2. **Agent Assignment**
   - System determines appropriate agent
   - Heal Agent analyzes incident data

3. **Analysis and Recommendation**
   - Agent applies domain knowledge and past incidents
   - Generates recommendations for resolution

4. **Remediation**
   - User approves recommended actions
   - Agent executes approved remediation steps
   - Progress is tracked and reported

5. **Resolution and Learning**
   - Incident is marked as resolved
   - System updates knowledge base
   - Agent improves through feedback loop

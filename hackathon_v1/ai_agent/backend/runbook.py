Please work together to analyze this issue, create a detailed runbook, review it for technical accuracy, and format it professionally.

The process should be:
1. Analyst: Analyze the issue and ensure all fix steps are understood
2. RunbookWriter: Create the initial comprehensive runbook
3. TechnicalReviewer: Review for technical accuracy and completeness
4. Formatter: Ensure professional formatting and structure
5. All: Collaborate to refine the final document

The final runbook should be in markdown format and ready to be saved to {output_file}.
When the process is complete, Formatter should provide the final markdown document.

# Script to resolve Kubernetes resource starvation issue for the mortgagelending application

# --- 1. Stop affected services ---

echo "Stopping mortgagelending services..."

# Assuming the mortgagelending application is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment
kubectl scale deployment mortgagelending --replicas=0

# Alternatively, if using a StatefulSet:
# kubectl scale statefulset mortgagelending --replicas=0

# Wait for the pods to terminate gracefully
sleep 30  # Adjust sleep time as needed


# --- 2. Apply necessary fixes ---

echo "Applying fixes..."

# Option 1: Increase resource requests and limits for the mortgagelending deployment
# This assumes you have a YAML file (e.g., mortgagelending-deployment.yaml) defining the Deployment
# Modify the YAML file to increase the resources. For example:
#
# containers:
# - name: mortgagelending
#   resources:
#     requests:
#       cpu: "200m"      # Increased from a lower value
#       memory: "512Mi"   # Increased from a lower value
#     limits:
#       cpu: "500m"      # Increased from a lower value
#       memory: "1Gi"     # Increased from a lower value
# 
# Then apply the updated YAML:
# kubectl apply -f mortgagelending-deployment.yaml


# Option 2:  Scale up the cluster nodes (if resource limits are already sufficient but the cluster is too small)
# This requires cluster-admin privileges. Uncomment if applicable.
# kubectl scale --replicas=<desired_replica_count> <node_pool_name>


# Option 3: Evict lower-priority pods (if preemption is not working correctly)
# **CAUTION:** This can disrupt other applications. Use with care.
# First, identify the pods consuming the most resources:
# kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
# Then, manually evict the chosen pod(s):
# kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n <namespace> --grace-period=0 --force


# Option 4: Adjust Pod PriorityClass (if using priority and preemption)
# Ensure that the mortgagelending

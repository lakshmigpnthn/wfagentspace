# Incident Details:
# - Issue: 0/4 nodes are available: 2 Insufficient memory, 3 Insufficient cpu. preemption: 0/4 nodes are available: 4 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.
# - Application Affected: mortgagelending
# - Start Date: 4/10/2023, 4:30:00 pm
# - Priority: P1

# Script to resolve node resource exhaustion for the 'mortgagelending' application.

# --- Step 1: Stop the affected services ---

echo "Stopping mortgagelending services..."

# Assuming the application is deployed using Kubernetes
kubectl scale deployment mortgagelending --replicas=0

# Alternatively, if using systemd:
# systemctl stop mortgagelending.service

# Add other service stop commands as needed based on your deployment method


# --- Step 2: Apply necessary fixes ---

echo "Applying fixes..."


# Option A: Increase node resources (if possible)
# This requires cluster administrator privileges and is a longer-term solution
# kubectl edit node <node_name>  #  Increase CPU and memory requests/limits


# Option B: Optimize resource requests/limits for the application
echo "Optimizing resource requests/limits..."

# Update the deployment YAML file (e.g., mortgagelending.yaml) with appropriate resource requests and limits
# Example:
# resources:
#   requests:
#     cpu: "500m"
#     memory: "512Mi"
#   limits:
#     cpu: "1000m"
#     memory: "1Gi"

# Apply the updated YAML:
kubectl apply -f mortgagelending.yaml


# Option C: Identify and terminate resource-intensive pods not related to the application (if preemption failed)
echo "Checking for resource-intensive pods..."

# Find pods consuming high resources (adapt thresholds as needed)
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces | awk '$2 > 75 || $3 > 500 {print $1, $2, $3}' # CPU > 75%, Memory > 500Mi

# Manually inspect and delete non-essential pods if identified


# Option D: Implement Horizontal Pod
